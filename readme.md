Notes on use:

- Altering the stroke width automatically selects the Free Draw function.

- The Bezier Curve function automatically drops four adjustable control points where the canvas is clicked. The location of the click will be the centre of the bezier curve.

- The user must double click to exit the Bezier Curve funciton.

- The user must resize uploaded images to fit the canvas size. 

- The user must click on the canvas after changing the stroke width to activate it.

Known bugs:
